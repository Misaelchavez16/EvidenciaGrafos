# UNDIRECTED GRAPH WITH ADJENCY LIST

## Description
This was an assignment to implement some methods for creating a Graph class, and also some algorithm methods for the same class. For ths implementation, it wastn added the Dijkstra Method, as instructed by the professor. This class contains a DFS and BFS algorithm methods, for getting all the values on Graph, unrepitted, as a Linked list. Because we didn't implemented Dikstra for this implementation, weighs are not needed, so edges dont have weighs.
