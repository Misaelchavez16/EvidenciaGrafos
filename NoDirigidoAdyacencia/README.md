# UNDIRECTED GRAPH WITH ADJENCY LIST

## Description
This was an assignment to implement some methods for creating a Graph class, and also some algorithm methods for the same class. For ths implementation, it wasn't added the Dijkstra Method, as instructed by the professor. This class contains a DFS and BFS algorithm methods, for getting all the values on Graph, unrepitted, as a Linked list. Because we didn't implemented Dikstra for this implementation, weighs are not needed, so edges dont have weighs.
We used some other methodsd developed during this semester, for creating the Graph; we use LinkedList and Hashtable class, for creating the list containing vertexs and adjencys. 

## Example
For this example we are using the next Graph:
